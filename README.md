# touhou-ripoff

 A small unity prototype developed in C#, inspired by ZUN's Touhou Project series. The game features a boss battle that uses bullet hell patterns to attack, which the player, controlled with the WASD keys, must avoid. The player can shoot back with the Z key, use bombs with the X key which deal massive damage to the boss, and gain score by attacking and narrowly dodging bullets. Try to beat the boss without losing any lives!

 The bullet patterns use Particle Systems to optimise gameplay, allowing streams of objects to be simulated without needing to instantiate each bullet seperately. Animations are made in the built in Unity animation tool.
